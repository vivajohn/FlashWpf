# FlashWpf
Here I have implemented part of Audio Flashcards in WPF. This is similar to the Blazor app where I did the same thing. I was able to take some code
out of that project and put it in a library, which I can use for both projects. I also added support for an Azure Cosmos database and the application can switch between Azure and Firebase databases dynamically.
